[?] However, there was no Tommy in the front yard.

"Tommy?"

Tommy was a leaf. He was blowing down the street with the rest of his play-mates.

[?] "Hey," he called out, "the sights up here. They are spectacular. Come and see."

  Tommy and the maple leaf ignored him. 

  "I see something. I see the dump." The old leaf cried out. "I see smoke.
  Come up here. I see fire"

  "I see nothing, " the maple leaf said. 

  [?]Tommy was watching the shutters open and then shut, open and then shut.

  "Mom," he said, "may I go outside?"

  "Be careful," she said. "It's so windy today."
	
[1] It was a windy day.

	The Mailman barely made it to the front door. When the door opened, Mrs. Pennington said, "hello", but before she had a real chance to say "thank you", the mail blew out of the mailman's hands into the house and the front doo slammed in his face. Mrs. Pennington rand to pick up the mail.

	"Oh my," she said.


	...

[16] "There", she said, "it will be safe until we get home."
		
	Tommy smiled, ran to the car and got in. He rolled down the back indow and looked up into the sky. He wondered where the old leaf had gone. Perhaps one day he would see what the old leaf had seen. Perhaps.





[?] Tommy watched in fascination.
"If I was a leaf, I would fly clear across the world," Tommy thought and then ran out into the yard among the swirl of colors,






[?] "Where do you think we are going?"  Tommy asked the leaf.
"Does it matter?" the leaf replied.  "Have fun.  Life is short."

"I bet to differ," an older leaf said suddenly coming beside them.  "The journey may be short, but the end is the beginning."

Tommy pondered this the best a leaf could ponder.

"Where do we end up?"




[14] Tommy saw the fence surrounded the city dump.  He was happy to be with his friend.  THey woudl have fun in the dump.

Suddenly, a car pulled up.  It was Tommy's mom.  Mrs. Pennington wasn't about to let her little boy run into the city dump.
